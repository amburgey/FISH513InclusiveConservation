The [Pattern Lab organization on GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/) is the traditional way to give the Pattern Lab team feedback. If you have problems with code or ideas then GitHub is a decent first stop. Pull requests are always welcome.

## Gitter

The [Pattern Lab rooms on Gitter](https://gitter.im/orgs/pattern-lab/rooms) offer a place for the Pattern Lab community to ask questions and offer help to each other. The core team actively monitor the rooms. If you've built a tool using Pattern Lab or written a blog post please share it with us and the larger Pattern Lab community on Gitter. We'll also get it added to our [resources page](/resources.html).

## Slack

The stellar [Design Systems Slack](http://designsystems.herokuapp.com/) run by [@jina](https://twitter.com/jina) also has a #tool-pattern-lab channel that folks hang out in.

## Twitter

## The Pattern Lab Port Interop Group

The [Pattern Lab Port Interop Group](https://github.com/pattern-lab/the-spec/blob/draft/PL-PIG.md) discusses the commonalities between ports and tries to find ways to standardize our work together. To get an idea of upcoming features, request new ones, or provide feedback on implemented features check out the [issues queue](https://github.com/pattern-lab/the-spec/issues) on The Spec&#174;. We need and want your feedback.
